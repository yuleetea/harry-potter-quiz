// Where do I start?
// I need an object or an array? to hold my questions and answers. I saw a way to utilize classes to organize the array list
// I need a way to take the users input and validate it to know if it's correct or incorrect
// I need a function that'll calculate the users score at the end, and display a win IMG or a loss IMG depending on result, should also display score percentage afterwards IF/ELSE statement
// I can use a for loop to incrementally add/subtract from the users score i++
